# Movies-ETL
Create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. Develop one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia movies data, Kaggle movies metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the clean data to a PostgreSQL database.
